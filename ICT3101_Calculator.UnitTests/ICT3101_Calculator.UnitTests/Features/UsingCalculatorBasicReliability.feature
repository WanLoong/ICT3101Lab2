Feature: UsingCalculatorBasicReliability
	In order to calculate the Basic Musa model's failures/intensities
	As a Software Quality Metric enthusiast
	I want to use my calculator to do this

@basicReliability
Scenario: Calculate current failure intensity
	Given I have a calculator
	When  the initial failure intensity "10" and the average number of failures "50" and the total number of failure over infinite time "100" and calculate current failure intensity
	Then the current failure intensity should be "5"

@basicReliability
Scenario: Calculate average number of failures
	Given I have a calculator
	When the initial failure intensity "10"and the average number of failures "50" and  the total number of failure over infinite time "100" and number of CPU Hours "10" calculate the numbers of failures
	Then the number of failures experienced should be "63"
